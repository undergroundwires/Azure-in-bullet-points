# Implement and manage storage

## Create and configure storage accounts

- Storage account is top-level account for following services:
  - **Blob Storage**
    - Object and disk storage
    - Blob storage tiers
    - Azure Search integration
    - Blob Lease for exclusive write access
      - Pass in lease id to API to modify

          - Underlying storage for Azure SQL
        - ❗ Standard (HDD) / Premium (SSD) storage
        - ❗ 8 TB max file size
        - ❗ Only offered in General Purpose account types
    - ***Blob Storage Access Tiers***
      - Set on blob level.
      - Three tiers:
        1. **Hot Tier**: Frequent reads
            - Lower data access costs
            - Higher data storage costs
        2. **Cool Tier**: Accessed less frequently
            - Higher data access costs
            - Lower data storage costs

### Storage Account Security

- ***Management vs Data Plane***
  - Handled with RBAC in Azure AD
    - Can see storage keys: Owner, Contributor & Storage Account,Virtual Machine Contributor, Storage Account Key Operator Service
      - Reader cannot see storage keys
  - **Management Plane**
    - Administrative tasks e.g.
      - Viewing properties of storage account.
      - Deleting storage account.
      - Assigning roles to other users.
      - Modifying the configuration.
  - **Data Plane**
    - Requires access to storage account keys.
    - On blobs you can set access level to public access.
    - For authenticated access:
      - **Storage Account Keys**
        - Provides full access to the storage
        - 💡 Best practice: Give all admins and apps same key.
          - Enables you to:
            - Regenarate secondary key.
            - Update apps to use secondary key
            - Regenerate primary key
        - Can be managed by Azure Key Vault using Powershell
          - Storage account keys are stored as Key vault secrets.
          - Azure Key Vault syncs keys with storage Account
          - Storage account keys never returned to caller.
      - **Shared Access Signatures (SAS tokens)**
        - 💡 Better as it follows principle of the least privilege.
        - Contains permissions and start & end validity period.
          - Set read and/or write permissions.
          - Grant permissions to access only partition + row key ranges.
          - You can restrict access to IP Address(es)
          - Enforce HTTPS
        - Two types:
          - ***Service Level SAS***: Only to a single blob/file/table or queue storage.
          - ***Account Level SAS***: Applies to multiple services
        - ❗ It's generated by client and is not tracked by Microsoft.
          - Signature is signed with account key and ensures none of the parameters are tempered.
          - To invalidate, you'll need to regenerate storage account key used to sign SAS.
          - 💡 Better way: **Storage Access Policies**
            - Defined on container level.
              - In portal: Containers -> Right click on container -> Access policy
            - Permissions + validity period is on server side.
            - Service level SAS only.
            - Easy to revoke by deleting the policy or changing its validity period.
        - Example url:

            | URL part | Description |
            | -------- | ----------- |
            |`https://myacount.blob.core.windows.net/container1/file1.pdf` | URL to endpoint |
            | `?sv=2017-07-29` | Rest API version |
            | `&st=2018-04-30T19%3A19%3A19Z` | Validity start time |
            | `&se=2018-05-01T19%3A19%#A19Z` | Validity end time |
            | `&sr=b` | Type of resource |
            | `&sp=r` | Permissions |
            | `&sip=168.1.5.60-168.1.5.70` | IP Address / range *(optional)* |
            | `&spr=https` | Protocol *(optional)* |
            | `&sig=pk9oGEPqYyu0K4Gutfreq9n0CJqgnjYgkEwcIEL8I0%3D` | Signature |

      - **Azure AD authentication with RBAC**
        - Available for Blob and Queue services.
        - Azure AD provides OAuth 2.0 token
        - E.g. *Storage Blob Data Contributor*, *Storage Blob Data Reader*, *Storage Queue Data Contributor*, *Storage Queue Data Reader*
        - Subscription level (for all Storage Accounts), Resource group level, Storage level or Blob container/queue level.
        - For users, groups, applications, managed service identities.
        - You register your application in AD (App Registrations)
          - You can then assign roles to your application.
          - Roles can also be assigned to **Managed Service Identity (MSI)**
            - Can set up with Azure VMs, Function Apps, VM Scale Sets
            - Credentials are injected into service instance (e.g. client id and certificate)
            - Code calls local MSI endpoint to authenticate to the resource (e.g. storage)
        - Easier management, no need to handle SAS tokens or manage keys.
      - 💡 Azure Key Vault can manage storage account keys and generate SAS

- **Encrypt data in transit**
  - Enforced by enabling **Secure Transfer**
    - Requires HTTPS for REST API
    - Requires SMB 3.0 for Azure file service
  - When moving data e.g. between
    - Azure regions
    - On-prem to Azure storage
      - You can use Site-to-Site VPN, Point-to-Site VPN or Azure ExpressRoute.
  - The data is moved across internet.
  - 💡 Vulnerable to Azure, good to encrypt data.
    - Configuration from outside Storage Account always requires SMB 3.0
    - SMB 2.1 does not have encryption so it's only allowed between different Azure regions.
    - *Secure transfer required* option is disabled by default.
  - SAS tokens can specify only HTTPS can be used.
  - You can also use **client side encryption**:
    - Encrypt data within the application.
    - Double encrypted as Azure storage encrypts data as default.
    - Still good idea to enforce HTTPS
      - HTTPS has built-in integrity checks to avoid network data loss
    - There are SDKS for e.g. C#, JAVA.
    - Can leverage Azure Key vault to generate and/or store keys.

- **Encrypt data in rest**
  - Every storage account has encryption enabled by default and cannot be disabled.
  - Required for many compliances e.g. privacy.
  - **Storage Service Encryption (SSE)**
    - Encrypts data before it's written
    - Decrypts data before it's read
    - Allows you to get encryption without any code
    - Applies to Standard and Premium.
    - Uses 256 bit AES.
    - Keys are managed by Microsoft by default.
    - Allows you to use your own encryption keys.
      - ❗ Blobs and files only.
      - ❗ Can only enable after the account is created.
      - ❗ Key vault and storage account must be in same region
        - Can be in different subscriptions
  - **Azure Disk Encryption**
    - Encrypts data disks (VHD) of VM's.
    - Handles both managed & unmanaged disks.
    - Windows VM's -> Bitlocker encryption
    - Linux VM's -> DM-crypt
    - Integrates with Key Vault to manage keys.
      - ❗ Key Vault must reside in same region and subscription
      - When uploading encrypted VM, you can upload encryption keys to Azure Key Vault first.
        - Good for migrating as you can use same keys as on-premises.

- **Configure network access to the storage account**
  - By default, storage accounts are accesible by all networks including internet
  - Allows you to create trust boundaries
  - Setting up networking/firewall rule
    - ❗ Denies all traffic by default unless any connection are explicitly opened
  - In portal: Settings -> Firewalls and Virtual Networks -> Select Network
  - You can have VNets from the same region as storage account or in a paired region.
  - **Firewall** allows you to choose IP addresses that can access VM's
    - E.g. you can set up only ExpressRoute acces.
  - When you configure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks

## Import and export data to Azure

- You can use portal, PowerShell, REST API, Azure CLI, or .NET Storage SDKs.

    - It lets you send terabytes of data into Azure in a quick, inexpensive, and reliable way

## Azure files

- **Azure Files**
  - 99.9% SLA with availability, redundancy and disaster recovery.
  - Typical use cases:
    - Lift and shift
    - Hybrid solutions
    - Born-in-cloud applications that require shared storage are
    - Storage for cross-platform solutions
    - Any workload that currently uses a file server or NAS providing SMB access
  - REST compatible
  - **SMB**-compatible
    - File protocol over port 445
    - Can be mounted by Linux & windows & macOS compatible
    - Versions
      - **SMB 1**: Limited block sizes, chatty protocl
      - **SMB 2.1** *(Supported by Azure)*
        - No encryption
        - Better network performance than SMB 1.0
        - Group file shares, software shares

    - Talks through port 445 and outbound connection
  - ***Create Azure File Share***
    - Multiple Azure File shares can be created under a storage account
    - Each has a name and optional quota assigned
      - Quota limits the size up to 5120 GB
    - Storage -> Files -> File Share
  - ***File access***
    - Access is via standard SMB client
    - Dialect of SMB is negotiated between the client and Azure Files upon connection
    - Encryption used if outside the Azure region or if required as part of the storage account configuration
    - SMB access utilizes the storage account name *(as user name)* and access key *(as password)*.
    - REST access can utilize SAS tokens
  - **Azure Files Snapshot**
    - Delta snapshot of a file share
    - Read-only, you can download your snapshot or mount it.
    - Azure Backup can schedule and manage snapshots
    - ❗ 200 snapshots per file share
    - If the file share is deleted all snapshots are also deleted
  - ***Replication options***
    - DFS-R (before it was File Replication Service)
    - `xcopy`, `robocopy`
    - Considerations: locking of files, data consistency, amount of data replicated and maintaining ACLs.
    - **Azure File Sync**
      - Enables replication from a single Azure Files share to one or more Windows based file servers
        - Windows service are in a synchronozation group.
      - Utilizes an agent deployed on each Windows Server instance that's then registered with the Storage Sync service then added to a sync group.
      - Cloud tiering
        - Least used data is moved to the cloud
          - Leaves a thumbprint on the server providing transparent access
          - Data is pulled down when access is requested.
        - Tiering is based on maintaining a certain percentage of free space.
          - Ensures around 20% is always free in file server.
        - Can be disabled
        - Is scoped to a file sync namespace.
        - ❗ File must be higher than 64 KB
      - ***Quality of Service (QoS)***
        - Default configuration: Server will consume maximum possible bandwith for data transfer via the storage sync service.
        - Supports network limits to be configured
        - For a VM based file server, QoS of the hypervisor can be used.
      - Considerations:
        - Avoid actions that'd cause data to be pulled down from the cloud
          - E.g. anti-virus scans, backups on-premises
        - ACL (Access Control Lists) are replicated to the cloud but are not enforced when accessed via Azure Files.
          - 💡 Content should be restored to an IaaS VM file server to enable ACL enforcement.
        - Data can be pre-seeded via *Azure Databox* with some caveats
          - Enables pre-seeding instead of full copy over the network.
        - Be careful when combining other data replication technologies.
      - ***Workflow for replication***
        1. Deploy a storage account
        2. Deploy a *Azure File Share*
        3. Deploy *Storage Sync service*
            - Must be in same region as storage account
        4. Create a *sync group*
            - Sync group has:
              - Storage account & file share
              - Server endpoints
              - Cloud endpoints
        5. Register server
            1. Sync Service -> Registered Service -> Download **Azure File Sync Agent**
            2. Install the service and register the server
        6. Add file share into the *sync group* as server endpoint
            - 💡 You can have only 1 cloud endpoint for the same sync group
            - You can enable/disable cloud tiering
        7. Install agent on file server
            - Supported >Windows Server 2012
            - Selected files can be skipped
        8. Register server to the *storage sync service* as server endpint
      - ❗ ***Scale and Limits***
        - **15** storage sync services per subscription
        - **30** sync groups per storage service
        - **1** cloud endpoint and **50** server endpoints per sync group
        - **4** TB maximum space
        - **100** GB maximum file size
        - **64** KB minimum file size to be tiered
      - ***Troubleshooting***
        - Check if TCP 445 is open for outbound traffic.
        - In metrics you can monitor for problems.
        - In Sync Services -> Sync Groups -> Group -> You can see health status and action recommendations for problems for cloud and server endpoints
        - In Event Viewer you can check FileSync events
  
## Implement Azure backup

- ***Azure backup benefits***
  - Automatic storage management
  - Unlimited scaling
  - Application-consistent backup
    - Each and every recovery point it has information for what it needs to go back to recovery point
  - Data encryption both in-rest and and in-transit
  - Unlimited data transfer
  - Long-term retention
    - No time limit

- Backs up to **Recovery Services Vault**
  - Online storage entity in Azure used to hold data such as backup copies, recovery points and backup policies.
  - Storage account is automatically created an configured
    - Comes with LRS and GRS storage account.
      - Configure in Vault -> Backup Infrastructure -> Backup Configuration
  - All backups are listed and globally controlled in *Backup Jobs*
    - You can monitor status and get reports
    - You can filter the jobs
  - **Backup policy**
    - Settings
      - Policy type
        - Azure VM
        - Azure File Share
        - SQL Server in Azure VM
      - Backup frequency
      - Retention range: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly
  - You can set inbuilt RBAC roles to vault
    - ***Backup Operator***: Manage backups but cannot remove backup, create vault, give any roles.
    - Others e.g. : *Backup Reader*, *Monitoring Reader*
  - **Backup Alerts**
    - Vault -> Backup Alerts -> Configure notifications -> Enable e-mail notifications, choose severities (critical, warning, information), select notification (per alert or hourly digest)
  - ***Enable MFA***
    - Properties -> Security settings -> Enable
    - ❗ Cannot be disabled when enabled once.
  - You generate **Security PIN** for critical options and Azure Backup will prompt for the pin (Properties -> Security settings)
  - When ***creating a VM back-up*** you can enable back-ups and choose a vault and policy.
    - ❗ VM must be in same location as recovery vault
  - To delete a vault, ensure all backups are stopped, delete backup agents/servers
  - You can configure Azure Backup Reports in Vault -> Backup Reports -> Diagnostic Settings -> Turn on diagnostics
    - You can save reports in you can archive reports in *storage accounts*, *stream to event hubs*, *send to Log Analytics*
    - After you configure a storage account for reports by using a Recovery Services vault, you can connect Azure Backup from Power BI and get a dashboard.

- ***Pricing***
  - Pay as you go storage model
  - You pay per **Protected Instance**
    - Protected instance is an application server/workload or computer that's been configured to back up to Microsoft Azure

- ***Components***

  - **Microsoft Azure IaaS VM Backup**
    - Features
      - **Policy-driven backup and retention**
        - Scheduled and on-demand backups, multiple recovery points
        - You can hwoever use to backup directly with *Backup Now*
      - **Application-consistent backup**
        - No impact on production environment and no shutdown of VMs
      - **Fabric level backup**
        - Multiple backups, centralized management, detailed tracking
    - ❗ New VM created by backup won't have backup policy associated with it.
    - ***Restoring and file-recovery manually***
      - Go to back-up blade for VM.
        - Two alternatives:
          1. Back Up Items -> Select backup -> Restore VM -> Select snapshot
          2. VM -> Back-up
      - Different alternatives:
        1. **Restore VM**
            - Two alternatives:
              1. Create new VM
              2. Restore disks
        2. **File recovery**
            1. Select recovery point
            2. Download script and execute on VM
                - Mounts disks from the selected recovery point
                - 💡 If files are larger than 100 GB, restore whole VM instead
            3. Unmount disks after recovery
