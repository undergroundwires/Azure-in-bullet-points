# DevSecOps (Security)

- Philosophy of integrating security practices within the DevOps process.
- Makes security a responsibility of everyone on the team

## Best Practices

- Provide training
- Define requirements
  - Minimum-security baseline that takes account of both security and compliance controls
  - Ensure these are baked into the DevOps process and pipeline
  - Check at least for [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), [SANS Top 25](https://www.sans.org/top25-software-errors)
    - Top 5 from the Top 10
      1. Injection
         - Never trust any user input
      2. Broken authentication
         - Use custom or own authentication system rather than well known authentication systems
      3. Sensitive data exposure
      4. XML external entities
      5. Broken access control
         - Roles and permission poorly implemented or not implemented at all
- Define metrics and compliance reporting
- Use software composition analysis (SCA) and governance
  - Evaluate third party components for security & licensing
- Perform threat modeling
  - Helps you to
    - More effectively and less expensively identify security vulnerabilities
    - Determine risks from those threats
    - Make security feature selections and establish appropriate mitigations
  - At the very least, threat modeling should be used in environments where there is meaningful security risk.
- Use tools and automation
  - Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) into your IDE
  - Integrate Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST) tools into CI/CD
  - Choosing tools:
    - Tools must be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
    - Tools must not require security expertise.
    - Tools must avoid a high false-positive rate of reporting issues.
- Keep credentials safe
  - Do not store credentials in code
    - Consider using a bring-your-own-key (BYOK) solution that generates keys using a hardware security module (HSM).
- Use continuous learning and monitoring

## Threat Modeling

- Do it as soon as and often as possible
  - Not only when releasing a new feature because single line of code can change everything
- [Microsoft Threat Modeling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool) tools is a tool for threat modeling.
- Steps:
  1. Defining security requirements.
  2. Creating an application diagram.
  3. Identifying threats.
  4. Mitigating threats.
  5. Validating that threats have been mitigated.

## Security tools

- Open source library vulnerabilities and license
  - **[Whitesource](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/)** – Open source library vulnerabilities and license
  - **[Black Duck](https://www.blackducksoftware.com/)** – Open source library vulnerabilities and license
- Static security testing
  - **[Checkmarx](https://www.checkmarx.com/)** – Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool
  - **[BinSkim](https://github.com/microsoft/binskim)** – A binary static analysis tool that provides security and correctness results for Windows portable executables
- Penetration testing
  - **[OWASP ZAP](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/)** – penetration testing
    - 💡 passive tests with CI and active tests with nightly build
    - Better to use the [OWASP Zap/Weekly](https://hub.docker.com/r/owasp/zap2docker-weekly/) docker container within Azure Container Services to get latest updates.
  - **[Azure DevOps Security Kit (AzSk)](https://azsk.azurewebsites.net/)**
    - PowerShell cmdlets and guidance for security best practices
    - Scans your Azure resources (run PowerShell command) and provide CSV file with the scan result and recommendations as fix script.
    - You can run the recommendation fix with command to automatically fix issues
    - With Azure DevOps Security Kit (AzSk) (VSTS extension), you can scan whitelisted/blacklisted ports.
- Secret management
  - **[Azure Key Vault](./8.1.%20Azure%20Key%20Vault.md)**
- Governance & compliance
  - **Azure policy**
    - Natively create policies, e.g, you create a policy from Azure (portal/CLI/REST API) to prevent creation of VM with high cost or specific region
  - **Azure Blueprints** (Polices, RBAC, ARM)
    - Container above resource group / subscriptions.
    - Helps to apply roles & ARM templates in a repeatable configuration manner
  - [**Azure Artifacts**](./6.1.%20Azure%20Artifacts.md) to stay in control of the dependencies that are consumed
- **Azure Security Center**
  - Centralizes security policy management
  - Continuous security assessment
  - Actionable recommendations
  - Prioritized alerts and incidents
  
## Penetration testing

- To find out weaknesses in the system
- **Passive Tests** or **Passive Scan**
  - Scan the target site as is but don't try to manipulate the requests to expose additional vulnerabilities.
  - Runs fast and good candidate for CI as they complete in minutes
- **Active Tests** or **Active Scan**
  - Also called as dynamic or fuzz tests because
  - Used to simulate many techniques that hackers commonly use to attack websites
  - Tries a large number of different combinations to see how the site reacts to verify that it doesn't reveal any information
  - CI/CD pipeline should run within a few minutes, so you don't want to include any long-running processes.
    - Nightly tests are a good idea.
- [OWASP ZAP](https://github.com/deliveron/owasp-zap-vsts-extension) is a free penetration testing tool for beginners to professionals
  - OWASP Zap/Weekly docker container within Azure Container Services ensures the image is always updated.
- Example pipelines:
  - Application CI/CD:
    1. Build
    2. Static Security Scan
    3. Package
    4. Deploy
    5. **Passive Pentest**: Pull OWASP Zap Weekly => Start Container => Run Baseline (1 to 2 min) => Report Results => High alerts - Fail, Release, All Alerts - Create bugs
  - Nightly OWASP ZAP Pipeline
    - Nightly Schedule
    - **Application Full Active Scan**: Pull OWASP Zap Weekly => Start Container => Spider Site => Run Active Scan => Report Results => High Alerts - Fail, Release, All Alerts - Create Bugs

## Continuous Security Validation

- Should be done at every point in application lifecycle:

  | Stage | Application CI / CD | Feedback | Nightly Test Runs |
  | ----- | ------------------- | -------- | ------------ |
  | **IDE / Pull request** | • Static Code Analysis • Code Review • Work Item Linking | • Code Review Comments • Static Code Rule Warnings | - |
  | **CI** | • Static Code Analysis • OSS Vulnerability Scan • Unit Tests • Code Metrics | • OSS Library Vulnerabilities • OSS License Violations • Failed Unit Tests • Static Code Rule warnings | - |
  | **Dev** | • Passive Pen Test • SSL Scanner • Infrastructure Scan | • Pen Test Issues • SSL Issues • Performance Issues • Regression Bugs | • Load and Performance Testing • Automated Regression Testing • Infrastructure Scan |
  | **Test** | • Infrastructure Scan | • Pen Test Issues • Infrastructure Issues | • Active Pen Test • Infrastructure Scan |

- CI/CD steps:

  1. When interacting with `master` branch.
     - Can be pull request / code commits / code merges...
     - PR to `master` should require a code review
       - Possible with a **branch policy** in Azure Repos
     - Commits should be linked to work items for auditing why the code change was made and require a CI.
     - Should have a PR-CI (Pull Request Continuous Integration)
       - 💡 You can use ***Static Code Analysis Code Review tools***
         - Highlights any security / vulnerability issues in code
  2. Continues integration through e.g. Jenkins
     - Difference from PR-CI => it does packaging also.
     - Should do Static Code Analysis with e.g.
       - [Visual Studio Code Analysis and the Roslyn Security Analyzers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool)
       - [Checkmarx](https://www.checkmarx.com/) - A Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool
       - [BinSkim](https://github.com/Microsoft/binskim) - Binary static analysis tool that provides security and correctness results for Windows portable executables
       - See [other tools](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2016/10/11/team-services-october-extensions-roundup-rugged-devops/)
     - Many tools integrate into the Azure Pipelines build process.
     - Scan for 3rd party packages for vulnerabilities & OSS (open-source) license usage
       - See [WhiteSource](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/), [Black Duck](https://www.blackducksoftware.com/)
     - Also run unit tests & report code metrics
  3. Promoting to development  & test (QA) stage
     - Verify that there are not any security vulnerabilities in the running application
       - = Automated Penetration testing
     - Infrastructure scanning
       - Is your hardware up-to-date? Are all tools installed on development machine? Are all tools patched with latest security patches?
       - E.g. Azure Security Center to report and Azure Policies to prevent.
       - E.g. Both immediate & nightly runs of port scanning to check against blacklisted/whitelisted ports
     - Load and Performance testing, Automated Regression Testing

## Container Security

- Container security best-practices: ([whitepaper](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/container-security-in-microsoft-azure/en-us/))
  - Scan for vulnerabilities before pushing images to registry.
  - Continue scanning in the registry because new vulnerabilities are discovered all the time.

## Continuous Assurance

- Tracks configuration drift
  - Checks for "drift" from what is considered a secure snapshot of a system
- Treat security truly as a 'state' as opposed to a 'point in time' achievement
  - important in today's context when 'continuous change' has become a norm.
- 2 types of drift:
  - Drift involving 'baseline' configuration
    - Often pre-defined/statically determined ones
    - E.g. SQL DB can have TDE encryption turned ON or OFF
  - Drift involving 'stateful' configuration
    - Cannot be constrained within a finite set of well-known states.
    - E.g. the IP addresses configured to have access to a SQL DB
