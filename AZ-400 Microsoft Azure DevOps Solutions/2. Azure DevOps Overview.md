# Azure DevOps Overview

## Interacting with Azure DevOps

### Azure CLI

- You can use [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) with the [Azure DevOps extension](https://github.com/Azure/azure-devops-cli-extension) to work with Azure DevOps
  - Enables automate everything as you can script anything and hook it in a build pipeline.
- Run on Linux, macOS or Windows
- Accessible via browser using Azure Cloud Shell
- It structures as group, sub group and commands
  - `az –help`: display all groups, sub groups and commands
    - e.g. `vm` is sub group of `az` so you can run `az vm -help` too
  - Find command: `az find -q MyCommand`

### Azure PowerShell

- PowerShell providing services like Shell and Command parsing
- Base PowerShell has 2 format:
  - Windows PowerShell
  - PowerShell core (Cross platform, Linux and macOS)
- Cmdlets are shipped in modules
  - Module is a .DLL that include the code for Cmdlet
  - Cmdlet is loaded by loading all its modules
  - `Get-Module` to get list of all loaded modules.
- Azure PowerShell is a PowerShell module that can be added to Windows PowerShell & PowerShhell core
  - Accessible via browser using Azure Cloud Shell
- 💡 Can store templates or scripts on Azure Storage account and securing them with SAS token

## Azure DevOps tool landscape

- **Azure Repos**

  - You can use Git repositories or Team Foundation Version Control.
- **Azure Pipelines**
  - Helps providing build & release services for continuous integration & delivery
- **Azure Boards**
  - Agile tools that support planning and tracking work items
- **Azure Test Plans**
  - Tools for testing your applications
- **Azure Artifacts**
  - Allows teams to work with `maven`, `npm` and `NuGet` packages
