# Creating Web Applications using PaaS

## App Service Environments (ASEs)

- Isolated/dedicated environment for securely running App Service apps.
- High scale: Multiple ASEs can be used to scale horizontally
- Isolation and secure network access
  - Isolated running only one customers applications.
  - Always deployed into a VNet.
    - Can have network security groups (NSGs) to control inbound & outbound traffic.
    - Can have web application firewalls (WAFs)
- It's deployed on App Service Plan.
- Can run Web Apps, Docker containers, Mobile Apps, Functions
- Pricing: comes with its own pricing tier "Isolated offering"
- ❗ Limitations
  - Everything in-between from
    - Single instance in 100 app service plans
    - 100 instances in a single App Service plan
- Consists of two parts
  1. **Front-ends**: Responsible for HTTP/HTTPS termination, automatic load balancing.
  2. **Workers**: Host customer apps. Three fixed size:
     - One VPU/3.5 GB RAM,Two vCPU/7GB RAM, Four vCPU/14 GB RAM

## Web App

- VNET Integration exists only in Standard, Premium, Isolated.
- Create an Azure Service Web App
  - Create resource group => Create app service plan => Create web app => Deploy the app

### Web App for Containers

- Choose Docker image
  - or with deployment configuration file for Docker Compose / Kubernetes image from Azure Container Registry, Docker Hub, Private Registry.
- Web App for Containers vs Azure Container Instances
  - **Web Apps for Containers**
    - Deploy web applications on Linux using containers
  - **Azure Container Instances**
    - Easy way to run containers on Azure with a single command without any orchestration.

## WebJobs

- Background tasks that enables you to run a program or script in the same context as a web app.
  - E.g. `.cmd`, `.bat`, `.exe`, `.ps1`, `.sh`, `.php`, `.py`, `.js`, `.jar`
- To create you can have CI/CD from GitHub or upload `.zip` containing your WebJob directly.
- Set "Always On" for reliability.
- 📝 Scheduled vs continuous

  | Context | Scheduled | Continuous |
  | ------- | --------- | ---------- |
  | Start | When scheduled or triggered manually. | Immediately. Runs in an endless loop. |
  | Multiple instances of WebJobs | On a single instance that's load balanced. | Runs all on instances |
  | Remote debugging | Not supported | Supported |
  | Scaling | Not supported | Determines whether the program or script runs on all instances or just one instance. ❗ Not possible on Free or Shared pricing tiers. |

## Using Swagger to document an API

- Swagger is set of tools around OpenAPI (JSON standard to define APIs)
- **Swashbuckle**
  - .NET Core package that builds swagger documents from code.
  - Embeds UI for customizing swagger documents.
  - Set up:
    - In `Startup.ConfigureServices`: `services.AddSwaggerGen(c => c.SwaggerDoc("v1", new Info { Title = "My API", Version = "v1" }));`
    - You can here document other information such as *Contact*, *License*, *TermsOfService*, and *Description*.
  - Enable middleware & set-up json UI in `Startup.Configure`:

    ```c#
      app.UseSwagger();
      app.UseSwaggerUI(c => c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "My API V1");
    ```

    - Swagger is then accessible at `/swagger/v1/swagger.json` and `/swagger`
  - Build swagger from XML documentation:
    - Enable XML documentation file in .csproj: `<GenerateDocumentationFile>true</GenerateDocumentationFile>`
    - You'll get warning for undocumented types and members.
      - You can suppress them with inline code or set `<NoWarn>$(NoWarn);1591</NoWarn>` in `.csproj`.
    - In `Startup.ConfigureServices` enable XML documents via reflection:

      ```c#
        c.IncludeXmlComments(Path.Combine(AppContext.BaseDirectory, $"{Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Name}.xml"));
      ```

    - You can then just XML document Action results with `<summary>` and `<param name ="id">` tags.
- Declaring models with attributes
  - You can set attributes on view models such as `[Required]` or `[DefaultValue(false)]`
  - On controller you can use `[Produces("application/json")]`
  - On actions you can use `[ProducesResponseType(201)]` and then document with `<response code="201"/>` XML tag.

## Azure Logic App

- IPaaS: Integration Platform as a Service
- Automate tasks & integrates apps, data, systems and services by automating tasks and business processes as workflows.
- Workloads e.g.:
  - Move uploaded file from an SFTP or FTP server to Azure Storage.
  - Process and route orders across on-premises systems and cloud services.
  - Monitor tweets for a specific subject, analyze the sentiment, and create alerts or tasks for items that need review.
- 200+ integrations such as Service Bus, Functions, Office 365, Oracle DB etc.
  - Each connector provides triggers and/or actions specifically.
  - **Enterprise Integration Pack**
    - Handles B2B integrations, like BizTalk.
    - Can handle different protocols such as As2, X12, EDIFACT
    - Can transform different formats.
    - Support for encryption & digital signatures.
    - Flow
      - Create an integration account in the portal => Add partners, schemas, artifacts, maps & agreements (reusable artifacts) => Create logic map => Link Logic app to the account => In Logic App, you can use partners and other artifacts from the integration account.
- You can have custom connectors.
  - They're function-based (Azure Functions).
  - Flow: Build your API => Describe your API (Swagger/OpenAPI) and define connector => Use connector => (Optional) Share & Verify your connector
- Applications are defined in a JSON file, they support ARM.
- You can use Azure portal or Visual Studio.
  - Visual Studio
    - You can add apps to source control, publish different versions.
    - Flow: New > Project => Visual C# => Select Resource Group => Modify `LogicApp.json` => Deploy
