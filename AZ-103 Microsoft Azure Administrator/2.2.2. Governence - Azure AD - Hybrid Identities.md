# Hybrid Identities

- Hybrid (common) identity = Cloud + On Premises identity
- Connection is done through Azure AD connect

## Four Pillars

- ***Unified Development and DevOps***: A common approach to building applications, and full flexibility to deploy in the cloud or on-premises
- ***Integrated management and security***: Built-in management and security solutions across full operational lifecycle from cloud to on-premises
- ***Common Identity***: Enable end-user productivity with single sign on to cloud and on premises applications while protecting corporate data
  - ***Single identity***: Create and manage a single identity for each user across your hybrid enterprise, keeping users, groups and devices in sync
  - ***Single Sign-on***: Provide single sign-on access to your application including thousands of pre-integrated SaaS apps
  - ***Conditional Access***: Protect identities by enforcing risk-based conditional access policies and multi-factor authentication for both on-premises and cloud applications
  - ***Remote Access***: Provide secure remote access to on-premises web applications through Azure AD **Application Proxy**
  - ***Self Service***: Self service password reset and application access requests for directories in the datacenter an the cloud
  - ***High Availability***
  - ***Collaboration***: Enable vendors, contractors and partners to get risk-free access to in-house resources
  - ***Consistency***: Truly consistent capabilities
- ***Consistent Data Platform***: Seamlessly distribute dat between cloud and on-premises, and enrich with analysis and deep learning

## Azure AD Connect

- Integrate your on-premises AD or LDAP directory to the cloud
- Establish a single identity for your us ers to access on-premises and cloud-based resources
- Connect your users to thousands of SaaS applications published through Azure
- ***Preparing for Azure AD Connect***
  - Create a new user in Azure AD as Global Administrator
  - Download Azure AD Connect and install it.
    - You need > Windows Server 2008
- **Install and configure Azure AD Connect**
  - Installation settings:
    - ***Initially***
      - Custom or Express installation
      - Installation location
      - Create an express SQL or use an existing SQL instance
      - Provide a service account or create a new one
        - Service account for SQL server
      - Custom sync groups
        - Fill: Administrators group, operators group, browser group, password reset groups
        - AD Connect groups not domain groups!
    - ***Then***
      - ***How users will sign-in***
        - One of them: *Password synchronization*, *Pass-through authentication*, *Federation with AD FS*
        - *Enable sign on* -> Yes, No
      - ***Forest and Azure credentials***
        - *Global administration username password*
        - *Select directory type (AD or LDAP)*
          - Then type *Forest name*
        - *Create new AD account* or *use existing AD account*
        - Type *domain username and password*
          - 💡 Recommended to enter Enterprise Admin credentials
      - ***Select UPN for sign-in***
        - E.g. `azure-contoso.com`
        - *Select user name*: e.g. userPrincipalName, treeName, unicodePwd
    - ***Then***
      - ***Choose what domains and OUs get synchronized to the cloud***
        - *Sync all domains* and OUs or *sync selected domains and OUs*
      - ***How to uniquely identify users***
        - Identification:
          1. *Users are represented only once across all directories*.
          2. *User identities exist across multiple directories*.
              - Match using: mail attribute, specific attribute, etc.
        - Source anchor (ID)
          1. *Let Azure manage the source anchor for me*
          2. *Specfic attribute*: objectGUID, pager, objectSid etc.
      - ***Filter users and devices by group***
        1. *Synchronize all users and devices*
        2. *Synchronize selected*
      - ***Optional features***
        - *Exchange hybrid deployment, exchange mail public folders, azure AD app and attribute filtering, password synchronization, password writeback, group writeback, device writeback, directory extension attribute sync.*
      - ***Enable single sign on***
        - ❗ Requires domain administrator account
      - ***Choose staging mode or install it***
        - **Staging mode**: Synchronization won't synchronize any data to Azure AD
    - ***Post installation***
      - Install AzureAD powershell module
      - 💡 Then enable Azure AD recycle bin
- Metaverse
  - What'll be synced in the next synchronization
    - Connectors to and from on-premises AD
    - Connectors to and from Azure AD
  - Controls what attributes from what objects from what location are available for synchronization
- Manage in Azure AD Connect -> Synchronization Service
- Adjust to business changes after Azure AD Connect is installed.
- Change the service accounts
- Add the **Managers** OU to be included in the synchronization

## Hybrid Planning

### Sign On

- **Authentication and Authorization**
  - *How do users typically login to their on-premises environment?*
  - *How will users sign-on to the cloud?*
  - *Will you be allowing workers from partner networks access to cl oud and on-premises resources?*
- **Multi Factor Authentication**
  - *Do you currently implement multi-factor authentication?*
  - *What are the key scenarios that you want to enable MFA for?*
  - *Will you use MFA to secure Microsoft Apps?*
  - *Will you use MFA to secure remote access to on-premises apps?*
- **Delegation and Administration**
  - *Does your company have more than one user with elevated privilege to manage your identity system?*
  - *Does your company need to delegate access to users to manage specific resources?*
  - *Does each delegated user need the same access?*

### Synchronization

- **Directory synchronization**
  - *Do you have a disaster recovery plan for the synchronization server?*
  - *Where will the synchronization server be located?*
    - E.g. if it's behind a firewall, you'll need to open up some ports
  - *Do you have any other directory on-premises like LDAP or an HR database?*
  - *Does your company use Microsoft Exchange?*
- **Multi Forest synchronization**
  - *Are the UPNs unique in your organization?*
    - More than one forest -> You can call people samething as other people -> You won't be able to do that in single Azure AD as they need unique UPNs.
  - *Will the Azure AD Connect server be able to get to each forest?*
  - *Do you have an account with the correct permissions for all forests you want to synchronize with?*
- **Password synchronization**
  - *Do you have restrictions on storing passwords in the cloud?*
  - *Will your employees be able to reset their own passwords?*
  - *What account lockout policy does your company require?*

### Applications

- **Applications**
  - *Will users be accessing on-premises applications? In the cloud? Or both?*
  - *Are there plans to develop new applications that will use cloud authentications?*
    - If so, then make sure that authentication can use OAuth, certificates e.t.c.
  - *Will cloud users be accessing applications on-premises?*
  - *Will on-premises urers be accessing applications in the cloud?*
- **Access Control**
  - *Does your acompany need to limit access to resources according to some conditions?*
  - *Does your company have any application that needs custom control access to some resources?*
  - *Does your company need to integrate access control capabilities between on-premises and cloud resources?*
  - *Does each user need the same access level?*

### Domain Structure

- **Domain Name**
  - *What name will your organization use for your domain in the cloud?*
  - *Does your organization have a custom domain name?*
  - *Is your domain public and easily verifiable via DNS?*
- **Directory Structure**
  - *How many AD forests do you have?*
  - *How many Azure AD directories?*
  - *Will you filter what user accounts are synchronized with the Azure AD?*
  - *Do you have multiple Azure AD Connect servers planned?*
  - *Do you have different directory that users authenticate against?*
- **Federation**
  - *Will you use the Azure Federation or on-premises AD FS?*
    - An option is moving on-premises AD FS to Azure Federation.
  - *More federation services for identities are provided now through Azure*
  - *Does your organization use smart cards for Multi Factor Authentication*

## Forest to Azure AD Topology

- ❗ Restrictions
  - One to one relation between Azure AD and AD Connect
    - Multiple AD Connect can not connect to Single azure AD
    - Azure AD Connect cannot connect to multiple Azure AD directories
  - The same user account cannot sync to multiple Azure AD directories
  - Users in one Azure AD cannot appear as contacts in another Azure AD directory
- **Single Forest to Single Azure AD**
  - *Single Forest -> Single AD Connect -> One Multiple AD*
  - Most common topology
  - 💡 Recommended by Microsoft
  - Expected topology when using Azure AD Connect Express installation
  - Supports multiple domains
- **Single Forest to Multiple Azure AD**
  - *Single Forest -> Multiple AD Connects -> One Multiple AD*
  - Useful when e.g. some users passwords cannot be written back to the cloud but another departmant caa do it.
  - ❗ Azure AD Connect sync servers must be configured for mutually exclusive filtering.
  - ❗ Users in one Azure AD will only be able to see users from their own Azure AD instance.
  - ❗ A DNS domain can only be registered in a single Azure AD directory.
  - ❗ Some write-back features not supported with this topology
    - No group / device writeback
- **Multiple Forest to Single Azure AD**
  - *Multiple Forest -> One AD Connect -> One Azure AD*
  - ❗ Users must have only one identity across all forests
  - The user authenticates to the forest in which their identity is located.
  - All forests are accessible by Azure AD Connect
  - ❗ Users have only one mailbox
- **Multiple Forest to Multiple Azure AD**
  - *Multiple Forest -> Multiple AD Connects -> Multiple Azure ADs*
  - Useful especially if you need isolation for different forests.
  - For each instance of Azure AD, you'll need an installation of Azure AD Connect
  - Users in one Azure AD will only be able to see users from their AAD instance.

## Register domain name

- ***Add Azure AD Domain Name***
  - Create directory where organiatison name is `contoso.local`.
  - Add domain name `azure-contoso.com` and verify through TXT DNS entry.
- ***Add UPN Suffix***
  - On-prem resources has `name@contoso.local` but you'll need `name@azure-contoso.com` to allow e.g. SSO.
  - Flow:
    1. Add `azure-contoso.com` as an alternative UPN Suffix through Active Directory Domains and Trusts
    2. Add `azure-contoso.com` to all user accounts as the preferred UPN suffix.

## Single Sign On

- **Password synchronization**
  - A copy of password and usernames is synchronized to the cloud.
- **Pass through authentication**
  - You don't store passwords in cloud
  - User is authenticated using pass through authentication agent that connects with on-premises AD
  - Works seamlessly with Azure Multi-Factor authentication
- **Seamless SSO**
  - Works with Azure AD Join or the desktop is previously joined to your AD domain
  - Requires Azure service endpoints to be added to the client browser's Intranet zone.
    - This way the browser can send the kerberos ticket to the website.
  - Flow:
    1. Client from a joined device tries to access to a resource in cloud.
    2. Local client goes to AD DC and gets an access token.
    3. Client forwards access token to Azure AD.
        - If MFA is enabled, it'll prompt user.

## Making cloud apps available

- Azure AD -> Enterprise Applications
- 4 Categories:
  1. Gallery applications
  2. Applications you're developing, integrated with Azure AD
  3. On-premises applications with Azure AD Application Proxy
      - **Azure AD Application Proxy**
        - Allows Azure to reach on-premises resources.
        - Consisten access to private resources without a VPN.
        - Install App Proxy & Connector on-premises
          - ❗ Cannot be installed on a server with the Pass Through Authentication connector
          - ❗ You need to configure a CNAME on DNS for the particular domain work for it to work.
        - Set-up on Azure:
          - Add applications
          - Assign to users
          - Configure SSO
          - Provision just like any SaaS app
        - Flow for Azure user reaching on-premises resource:
          1. Azure AD gives a token to user
          2. User sends that token to Azure App Proxy
          3. Proxy takes UPN and SPN and gives it to connector
          4. Connector goes to on-prem AD and gets Kerberos ticket.
          5. It forwards it to actual on-prem application, it verifies the ticket and ticket is assigned to the cloud user.
  4. Non-gallery applications
- Manage permission: Azure AD -> Enterprise Applications -> In application -> Users and groups
- Configure SSO:
  1. Configure SSO for the new application
      - Manage permission: Azure AD -> Enterprise Applications -> In application -> Single sign-on
      - Sign-on types:
        - Password-based Sign-on
        - Linked Sign-on
        - SAML
          - Provides step by step guide for fedaration between application and Azure AD manually
  2. Click on the new application new in the Azure AD MyApps access panel
      - Access panel is reached at `myapps.microsoft.com`
      - It promts you to insall a browser extension
  3. Install Access Panel Extension
  4. Log into application so that password is stored for SSO
