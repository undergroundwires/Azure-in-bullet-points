# Load Balancer Options

- All load balancers are software appliances (software defined networking: SDN)
- 💡 Only Standard (not Basic) SKU allows availability zones in Load balancer

## Public Load Balancer

- OSI Layer 4 TCP and UDP
- Internet-facing, has public IP address
- Offers two distribution modes
- ***Set-up public load balancer***
    1. Settings -> Back-end-pools-> Add VM's
    2. Settings -> Health-probe -> Add health probe
        - E.g. tcp-80-probe (HTTP) probe
        - Set interval -> time between prop events
        - Set unhealth threshold (e.g. 2) before VM is dropped out from the pool
        - Add load balancing port
        - Incoming request from port 80 (*port*) will be passed to TCP passed 80 (*back-end port*)
        - Select backend pool & health-probe
        - Set session persistance
        - Floating IP (direct server return)
            - Use with internal load balancers
            - Use with SQL server always on cluster
            - Used when same back-end port needs to be used across multiple rules in a single Load Balancer.
    3. Add inbound NAT rule
        - Map TCP 5000 to a VM's RDP port (3389)
        - Map TCP 5000 to a VM's RDP port (3389)

## Internal load balancer

- OSI Layer 4 TCP and UDP
- Applies to traffic only within a virtual network
  - No public IP address
- Good for applying load balancing to n-tier application services (database)

## Application Gateway

- OSI Layer 7 application
- Application Delivery Controller (ADC) as a service
- SSL offload
- Has Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## Traffic Manager

- DNS-level
- Geographical load balancing
- Offers different routing methods
