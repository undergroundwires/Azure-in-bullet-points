# Security

## Role based access control

- Provides fine-grained access to resources
- AAA
  - A -> Authentication (identity)
  - A -> Authorization (abilities)
  - A -> Accounting (auditing)
- Higher to lower granularity: Subscription -> Resource group -> Resource
- Roles
  - Reader: Observers
  - Resource-specific or custom role, contributor: Users managing resources
  - Owner: Admins
- Custom roles are defined in JSON
- RBAC focuses on user actions at differen scopes.
  - By contrast, Azure Policy focuses on resource properties during deployment
    - Policies e.g. *Allowed virtual machine SKUs*, *Enforce automatic OS upgrade with app health checks on VMSS*
- You can manage in *Access Control (IAM)* blade.

## Storage Security

### Storage Service Encryption

- Protects data at rest in storage account
- 128-bit AES encryption
- Azure manages encryption keys
  - 💡 You can manage them yourself with Azure Key Vault

### Azure Disk Encryption

- BitLocker for Windows Server VMs
- DM-Crypt library for Linux VMs
- Protects OS and data disks
- Azure- or customer- managed disks
- Manage:
  - In VM blade -> Disks -> Add data disk
  - Use powershell
    1. Create key vault and vault key
    2. Create security principal (identity in Azure AD) that can take the key from key vault
    3. You run `SetRmVMDiskEncryption` to configure encryption

## Network-level security

### Network Security Group (NSG)

- Stateful firewalls
- Augmented security rules: Have inbound/outbound rules
- Can be bound to *public addresses*, *load balancers*, *subnets* and *VM*s.
- Traffic streams are identified with 5-tuple hash: Source, destination, port, protocol, IP addresses.
- Source can be service tags
  - In-built e.g. Internet
- Or custom (**Application Security Group** identifiers)
  - Simplifies NSG's
  - Logically groups VM's e.g. by role
    - Association is done through NICs
  - E.g. AppServers, DatabaseServers
  - Flow:
     1. Define ASGs
     2. Include ASGs in NSGs

### Host Firewalls

- E.g. Windows Defender Firewall on Windows Server VM's
- 💡 A range that's whitelisted in NSG can be blocked by host firewalls.

### Jumpbox Architecture

- Jumpbox is a pivot point VM in a VNet
- Good for auditing every administrative action
  - A shared jumpbox makes it easier to administrate the orchestration
- You can e.g. allow access to public IP and make sure it's locked down to that endpoint.
- Or you can e.g. point to Site-to-Site VPN or point-to-site VPN.

## Azure Security Center (ACS)

- Centralizes security policy management
- Continuous security assesment
- Actionable recommendations
- Prioritized alerts and incidents
- Integrated security solutions
  - E.g. recommends to deploy WAF

### Just-in-Time (JIT) VM Access

- Normaly to access a VM, you need 3389 for RDP protocol, or 22 to SSH for linux, you open those ports 7/24.
  - Not so secure as they're publically accesible if IP is public.
- JIT locks down inbound administrative port access
- Time-restricted access to specific IP address(es)
- Requires Azure Security Center standard
