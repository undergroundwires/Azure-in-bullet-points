# Subscriptions

## Resource tagging

- 💡Always tag!
- Tags are additional metadata that can be assigned to resources/resource groups.
  - ❗ Child resources do not inherit resource groups tags
  - ❗ Max 15 tag name/value pairs.
- E.g. `CostCenter = YHZ`
- Why?
  - Organize
  - Search
  - View
  - Billing & cost managements
- On Portal
  - You can search for Tags and see filtered lists.
  - ❗ Resources are tagged **after** resource is created as opposed to PowerShell/CLI.
