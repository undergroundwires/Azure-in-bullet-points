# Resource groups

- Logical grouping of resources that shares the same lifecycles.
  - Resource group holds different unique resources.
  - Resource groups can contain resources that reside in different regions.
    - Location of resource group is just the meta data for the resource group.

## Tags

- E.g. `Dept: IT`
- 💡 Tags are not inherited
- ❗ Max 15 tag name/value pairs.

## Locks

- For accidental deletion or accidental changes to resources within a resource group.
- Consists of two locks:
  - `CanNotDelete`
    - Authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource.
  - `ReadOnly`
    - Authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource.
    - Same as giving everyone a ***Reader*** role.
- Locks are inherited from resources within the resource group.
