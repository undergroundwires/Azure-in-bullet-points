# Storage

## Storage services

- Storage account is top-level account for following services:
  - Blob Storage
  - File Storage
  - Table Storage
  - Queue Storage

### Blob Storage

- Object and disk storage
- Blob storage tiers
- Azure Search integration
- Blob Lease for exclusive write access
  - Pass in lease id to API to modify
  - E.g. IaaS VMs lease Page Blob disks to ensure its managed by single VM
- You can create snapshots on blob level and view snapshots.

#### Azure Data Lake Storage

- Uses blob storage to store data
- Big data analytics
- Analytics interface and APIs
- Blob storage APIs
- Hadoop compatible access to data
- ❗ GPv2 Storage accounts only

#### Blob Types

- **Block Blob**
  - Composed of 100 MB blocks
  - Optimized for efficient upload
  - Insert, replace, delete, blocks
  - ❗ Up to 4.77TB max file size
  - ❗ 50.000 max blobs
- **Append blob**
  - Can only append blocks
  - Ideal for log and audit files
  - ❗ 195GB max file size
- **Page Blob**
  - Optimized for frequent read/write operations
  - Good for VM disks and databases
    - Foundation for IaaS disks
    - Stores VHD files.
    - Underlying storage for Azure SQL
  - ❗ Standard (HDD) / Premium (SSD) storage
  - ❗ 8 TB max file size
  - ❗ Only offered in General Purpose account types

#### Blob Storage Access Tiers

- Set on blob level.
- Three tiers:
  1. **Hot Tier**: Frequent reads
      - Lower data access costs
      - Higher data storage costs
  2. **Cool Tier**: Accessed less frequently
      - Higher data access costs
      - Lower data storage costs
      - Optimized for data that's stored 30 days
  3. **Archive Tier**: Take hours to get data available
      - Highest data access cost
      - Lowest data storage cost
      - Optimized for data that's stored 180 days
      - ❗ Only supported for Block Blobs
- Changing storage tiers incurs charges
- ❗ Can't change the Storage Tier of a Blob that has snapshots
- **Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle Management Policies**
  - E.g. configure a policy to move a blob directly to the archive storage tier X days after it's uploaded
  - Storage Account -> Blob Service -> Lifecycle Management
  - Executed daily

#### WORM: Write Once Read Many

- Cannot be erased or modify for certain period of time.
- Set on container level
- Enable: Access Policy -> Add Policy -> Time-based retention *(set retention period)* / Legal hold *(attach tags)* -> Lock policy

#### Soft Delete

- Saves deleted for a specified period of time
  - Storage Account -> Blob Services -> Soft Delete

#### Static Website Hosting

- When activated it creates $web container.
- You need to have default document and error page.
- You can integrate Azure CDN
  - **Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)**
    - Distributed network of cache servers
    - Provide data to user from closest source
    - Offload traffic from origin servers to CDN
      - Typically static data
    - Pricing tiers are Microsoft, Akami, Verizon (Microsoft partners)
    - Supports *HTTPS*, *large file download optimization*, *file compression*, *geo-filtering*
    - Azure CDN Core Analytics is collected and can be exported to blob storage, event hubs, Log Analytics.
  - Azure Storage blob becomes ***origin server***.
  - Azure CDN servers become ***edge servers***
  - CDN can authenticate to Blob Storage with SAS tokens to be able to read private data.
  - ***Caching rules***: On blobs you can set CDN caching rules, such as `CacheControl:max-age=86400` in blob properties.
  - ***Set up***: Two alternatives
    - Create CDN and configure against blob service.
    - Storage account -> Blob service -> CDN
- You can have custom domain
- You can have CORS policies

#### Azure Search

- Integrates with ***Azure Search***
- You can provide metadata in blobs, they'll be used as fields in search index which helps categorize documents and aid with features like faceted search.
  - You can choose index content, content+metadata or just metadata.
- Searchable blobs can be *PDF, doc/docs, xls/xlsx, ppt/pptx, msg, HTML, XML, ZIP, EML, RTF, TXT, CSV, JSON*.
- **Azure Search**
  - ***Structure***: Index, Fields, Documents
  - ***Data Load***: Push data in yourself, pull data from Azure sources (SQL, Cosmos DB or blob storage)
  - ***Data Access***: REST API, Simpleq Query, Lucene, .NET SDK
  - Features:
    - ***Fuzzy search*** handles misspelled words.
    - ***Suggestions*** from partial input.
    - ***Facets*** for categories.
    - ***Highlighting*** search tags for the results.
    - ***Tune and rank*** search results
    - ***Paging***
    - ***Geo-spatial search*** if index data has latitude and longtitude, user can get related data based on proximity
    - ***Synonyms***
  - Lexical analysis done by *Analyzers*
  - You can combine following cognitive skills in pipelines: OCR, language detection, key phrase extraction, NER, sentiment analysis, merger/split/image analysis/shaper.

### File Storage

- SMB File Shares
- Attach to Virtual Machines as file shares
- Integrates with Azure File Sync
  - On-prem to Azure sync with caching strategy

### Table Storage

- NoSQL Data Store
- Scheme-less design
- Azure Cosmos DB

### Queue Storage

- Message based
- For building synchronous applications
- URL format: e.g. `http://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net`

## Account Types

### Blob Storage Account

- *Supported services*: Blob storage
- *Supported blob types*: Block blobs, append blobs
- Supports blob storage access tiers (hot, cool, archive)

### General Purpose V1

- *Supported services*: Blob storage
- ❗ Does not support blob storage access tiers (hot, cool, archive)
- ❗ Classic deployment & ARM
- ❗ Does not support ZRS (Zone Redundant Storage) replication
- Slightly cheaper storage transaction costs, can be converted to V2.

### General Purpose V2

- Supports all latest features.
  - Including anything in General Purpose V1 and blob storage access tiers.
- 💡 Recommended choice when creating storage account.
- Lower storage costs than V1
- ❗ Has a changing soft limit (as of now 500 TB)
  - You can contact Azure support and request higher limits (as of now 5 PB). Same for ingress/egress limits to.

## Account Replication

- Impacts SLA
- **Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)**
  - Three copies of data in single data center.
  - Data is spread across multiple hardware racks.
- **Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS)**
  - Three copies of data in different availability zones in same region.
  - ❗ Only available for GPv2 storage accounts
- **Geo-reduntant Storage (GRS)**
  - Three copies of data in two different data centers in two different regions.
  - ❗ You don't get to choose second region, they're paired regions decided by Microsoft.
  - ❗ Replication involves a delay.
    - RPO (recovery point objective) is typically lower than 15 minutes.
- **Read-access Geo-reduntant Storage (RA-GRS)**
  - Same as GRS, but you get read-only access to data in secondary region.

## Azure Storage Explorer

- Cross-platform client application to administer/view storage and Cosmos DB accounts.
  - Can be downloaded with Storage Account -> Open in Explorer in Portal.
  - Available in Azure portal as well (preview & simpler)
- Can manage accounts across multiple subscriptions
- Allows you to
  - Run storage emulator in local environment.

  - Manage soft delete:
    - Enables recycle bin (retention period) for deleted items.
- Connecting and authentication
  - Admin access with accont log-in
  - Limited access with account level SAS
