# Deployment

- Deployment tools: Azure portal, Azure Cloud Shell, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI v2.0, Azure SDKs, ARM templates
- You can create from
  - User images
    - Uses unmanaged disks
  - Marketplace images

## Create VM Image

- As first step, generalize VM
  - Generalization resets server-specific data:
    Computer name
    - Security identifiers (SIDs)
    - Local administrator/root identity
    - Device driver cache
    - Event logs
  - How to generalize
    - On Windows use sysprep, "System Preparation Tool"
    - On Linux run `sudo waagent -deprovision+user`
    - Take a VM backup first, because generalization is destructive and permanent
  - **Create VM image from Azure VM**
    - Managed Disk Concepts
      - Disks
        - No storage account (management) required
        - Pay for pre-allocated storage (P10 =128 GB SSD VHD)
      - Snapshots
        - Read-only full copy of a managed disks
        - You can create new VM's based on snapshots
      - Images
        - Generalized VM disk images
        - Snapshots can be converted into images
    - ***Flow***
      1. Get an image:
          - Get a snapshot image
            1. Go to Disks -> Select OS disk -> Create snapshot
            2. In snaphot -> Click on Export -> You'll get SAS url -> Download VHD
            3. Generalize the image
          - Or capture an image
            - VM -> Overview -> Capture
            - ❗ Not generalized
            - It appears in images
      2. Go to Images in portal, select the image, from there click on Deploy and it'll navigate you

## VM Connection

- You have different levels of security NSG, host firewall, options to have public IP or not
- **Just-in-time VM Access**
  - Recommended to enable
  - Requires Azure Security Center Standard tier
  - Locks down all administrator ports as default, when admin requests admin session then session is bounded by time limit and IP address restriction while granting access.
  - No need to have management port open all the time

## Deploying Linux Server VM

- Around 40% of workloads in Azure runs on Linux
- Endorsed in Azure: CentOS, CoreOS, Debian, Oracle Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Enterprise Linux, openSUSE, Ubuntu
- Connection
  - **Secure Shell (SSH)**
    - A popular client is PuTTy for SSH or you can install *subsystem for Linux* or *git tools* on Windows 10 to get SSH.
  - **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**
    - You can install RDP on Linux.
    - Some do not believe in graphical shell:
      - Presents security vulnerability possible
      - Needlessly consumes CPU
    - Windows team ported RDP into linux.
  - **Serial Console**
    - COM1 serial port connection to VM
    - Low-level access
    - Helpful when e.g. your VM doesn't boot up
- **Authentication**
  1. SSH Public Key
      - You keep private key and share public key with Azure.
  2. Password
  - You can reset those after deployment in VM -> Reset password

## Deploying Windows Server VM

- Windows Server 2019, 2016, 2012, 2008, Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise (for e.g. load testing, client-side testing, jump-box)
- **Connect**
  - Remote Dekstop Protocol (RDP)
    - Uses TCP 3389
    - You can connect directly from Overview -> Connect
  - WinRM (PowerShell) Remoting
    - TCP 5985, 5986
  - Serial Console
    - Text console into VM
    - Can get to VM's that can't boot

## Prepare environment with Azure Policy

- **RBAC vs Azure Policy**
  - RBAC
    - Focuses on user actions at different scopes
    - VM Contributor can manage only VM
    - Built-in custom roles
  - Azure Policy
    - Focuses on resource properties during deployment for already existing resources
    - Uses default allow and explicit deny access system
  - Difference
    - You're not going to be able to create VM unless you have read & write abilities by RBAC
    - Azure Policy in contrast constrains what that RBAC can do when she/he attempts to create VM
- Some built-in Azure Policy definitions are e.g. *allowed locations*, *VM SKU*, *ensure MMS extension is deployed*
- You can create also own policies, or initiatives which are collections of policies.
- Example:
  - Policy -> Assign Policy
  - Policy defination: E.g. allowed locations
  - Parameters: Select which regions are allowed

## Deploy with ARM templates

- ARM templates are infrastructure as code foundation of automation and DevOps in Azure
- 💡 Visual Studio is a good ARM template editor
  - Visual Studio Code can also be used.
- Different ways to work with templates
  1. You can go to Portal -> Templates -> Usage existing usages or add a new template
  2. In Visual Studio -> Cloud -> Azure Resource Group -> You can select template location (e.g. github) -> Select a template
  3. Deploy a VM then in the last step click on "Download template and paremeters"
- You can deploy with PowerShell, Cloud Shell, Azure CLI, or directly from Visual Studio
- You can automate deployment actions such as VM access
- Files
  - `azuredeploy.json`
    - Deployment template.
    - Defines resources and property such as `Allowedvalues`, `defaultvalues`
    - You can refactor some values in variables and reuse in the file
    - `copy` element block in deployment script allows you to create e.g. 3 storages.
  - `azuredeploy.parameters.json`
    - Deployment parameters (required for deployment) to depoy `azuredeploy.json`
