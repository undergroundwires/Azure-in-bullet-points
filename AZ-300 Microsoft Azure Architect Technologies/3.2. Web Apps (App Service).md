# Web Apps

- PaaS for web applications.
- App Service Plan is the infrastructure app services run on.
  - Defines compute resources.
  - Can be a dedicated VM or shared.
  - ❗ You cannot move it to a different region, but you can clone apps.
- Multiple languages and frameworks are supported
  - E.g. ASP. NET, Node.js, Java, PHP and Python
  - Can run any scripts/executables on VM's.
- You can clone app across regions on premium.
- You can create from application templates (e.g. WordPress, Joomla, Drupal).
- Load balancing, auto scaling

## DevOps

- CI/CD from Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker Hub and other git sources.
  - Enable on app's menu blade -> App Development -> Deployment Options

### Deployment Slots

- **Deployment slot**: Another web-app that's linked to a web-app
  - dev <=> staging <=> production
- Standard => 5, Premium => 20 slots
- All slots have their own names & urls.
- Advantages:
  - Validate app changes in staging before swap (preview before swap)
  - No cold start
    - Ensures all instances are warned up with no downtime, no request drop
  - If it fails, you can swap back
- Swapping settings
  - Many settings are swapped, some are not.
  - You can choose some Application Settings to be sticky (won't swapped)

## Network

- Access on-premises data using Hybrid Connections with VNets.
  - You can use to access e.g. to on-prem database.

### App Service Environment

- Clusters servers
  - All the way from front-end load balancers, workers, databases, everything that composes your infrastructure
  - Runs entire configuration in a VNet.
- Configure inbound network traffic rules
- Setup a Web Application Firewall in front of your ASE

## Application Settings

- 📝 Always on => If VM goes down etc, Azure will try to turn VM on every 10-15 ms.
  - If you get little requests, VM is brought up when it's needed
- ARR affinity => You don't care for states, turn it off, it'll scale better.
- ❗ 64-bit: costs more memory, use it carefully

## Backup

- Only Standard or Premium tier.
- You need a storage in same subscription as the app.
- You can back-up databases as well if connection string exists in app settings.
  - works for: SQL Database, Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, MySQL in-app
- You can automate backup with back-up schedule: How often? When? Retention?
- You can exclude some files.

## Snapshots

- For premium or higher, snapshots are taken automatically.
- Advantages over back-ups:
  - No file copy errors due to file locks.
  - No storage size limitation.
  - No configuration required.
- 3 months of snapshots are kept, can only restore for the last 30 days.

## Azure Mobile App

- Native & cross-platform apps with e.g. Xamarin, Cordova, Unity.
- Can connect to on-premises.
- Build offline-ready apps with data sync: Syncs when internet is there
- Some special options:
  - **Azure Easy Table**: Light SQL on portal.
  - **Azure Easy APIs**: Code & build directly in Azure portal for Node.js back-end.

## App Service Security

### Infrastructure and platform security

- Managed by Azure = You trust Azure
- Your app service apps are isolated from both the Internet and from the other customers' Azure resources.
- Communication of secrets (e.g. connection strings) in a resource group does not cross any network boundaries and are always encrypted.
- All communication between App Service and external resources (e.g. REST) are encrypted.
- **Microsoft Threat Management**
- **Azure Security Center** => natively part of Azure + PaaS services
  - Monitors without any deployment
    - Can protect on-prem by installing "**Microsoft Monitoring Agent**"
  - Set monitor policies.
  - See Network Map of all VNet's
  - Helps you configure recommended controls (add firewall, use AAD etc).
  - **Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection**
    - On all VM's out of the box.
    - Protects from malware, DDoS, man-in-the-middle and more.
    - Man-in-the-middle
      - Reroutes communication between two users through the attackers computers without their knowledge. He can monitor and read the traffic before sending it on the intended recipient.
- Other protections:
  - SQL injection
  - Session hijacking
    - Active: Takes over clients position
    - Passive: Monitors the traffic for password etc.
  - Cross-site-scripting: via click or script tags malicious script is executed.

### Application security

- Customers responsibility not Azures.
- AAD integration, certification management, secure communication with different services etc.

#### Authentication & Authorization

- No code authentication
  - App Service can validate user assertations.
  - Uses JWT tokens
    - ADD => authorization header as bearer token
    - Mobile App Client SDK's
  - Federated identity
    - Identity providers
      - Default: AAD, Microsoft Account, Facebook, Google, Twitter.
      - Can be extended with custom providers.

#### Client certificate authentication

- Supports SSL certifications.
- Inbound (TLS mutual authentication)
  - Someone who wants to come to your site needs to present a certificate
  - Use API or Resource explorer to set.
- Outbound (using a client certificate from your app)
  - Application talks to another server and that servers requires app to have certification.
  - Set in App settings with `WEBSITE\_LOAD\_CERTIFICATION` key.
- Resource explorer = Visualizes API's and manage rules, you can force require inbound certification there you can also set "expect" one.

#### Static/Dynamic IP restriction

- Configured in web.config file.
- Static IP restriction: e.g. geo-fencing
- Dynamic IP restriction: e.g. DDoS protection
  - You set request frequency & concurrency rules.

### Security scanning

- Via 3rd party "Tinfoil Security"
- Paid & billed outside of Azure
- Managed in Kudo => Extensions
- Use e.g. before you switch slot from production you can see if you introduce any vulnerability.
