# Manage role-based access control (RBAC)

## Create a custom role

- 📝 Steps (through either PowerShell or Azure CLI)
  1. Determine the permissions you need
      - Add in `Actions` and `NotActions` for data operations use `DataActions` and `NotDataActions`.
      - You can see all operations through `az provider operation list`.
  2. Create the custom role
      - `az role definition create`
      - You need to have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write` permissions on all `AssignableScopes` such as *Owner* or *User Access Administrator*
- ❗ Limitations
  - Azure supports up to 2000 role assignments per subscription.
  - When you transfer a subscription to a different tenant, all role assignments are permanently deleted. You must re-create your role assignments in the target tenant.
- 📝 Example:

  ```json
      {
        "Name": "Virtual Machine Operator",
        "Id": "88888888-8888-8888-8888-888888888888",
        "IsCustom": true,
        "Description": "Can monitor and restart virtual machines.",
        "Actions": [
          "Microsoft.Storage/*/read",
          "Microsoft.Network/*/read",
          "Microsoft.Compute/*/read",
          "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/start/action",
          "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/restart/action",
          "Microsoft.Authorization/*/read",
          "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read",
          "Microsoft.Insights/alertRules/*",
          "Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/*",
          "Microsoft.Support/*"
        ],
        "NotActions": [],
        "DataActions": [],
        "NotDataActions": [],
        "AssignableScopes": [
          "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId1}",
          "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId2}",
          "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId3}"
        ]
      }
  ```

## Configure access to Azure resources by assigning roles

- Through a resource
  - Modify in *Access control (IAM)* in any Azure object.
  - In *Check Access* tab you can check access level of individual user, group, service principal or managed identity.
  - Add a role assignment
    1. Access control (IAM)  -> Add role assignment
    2. Select **Role** e.g. *Virtual Machine Contributor*.
    3. In the Select list, select a user, group, service principal, or managed identity.
- For built-in global roles such as *Contributor*:
  - AD -> Users -> Select user -> Directory role -> +Add role
- Assign roles to licenses: Azure Active Directory > Licenses
- Assign roles to devices: Azure Active Directory -> Devices

## Configure management access to Azure

- Securing privileged access requires changes to
  - Processes, administrative practices, and knowledge management
  - Technical components such as host defenses, account protections, and identity management
- Recommended roadmap:
  1. Stage 1: Critical items that Microsoft recommends that you do right away *(24-48 hours)*
      - General preparation
        - Turn on **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**
          - Organizations can give JIT user access to specific Azure AD & resources.
          - Help you protect access to applications and resources across the on-premises environment and into the cloud.
            - This includes creating separate admin accounts for users who need to conduct on-premises administrative tasks, deploying *Privileged Access Workstations* for Active Directory administrators, and creating unique local admin passwords for workstations and servers.
          - Define at least two emergency access accounts
            - E.g. if on-prem AD DS goes down.
            - Highly privileged and are not assigned to specific individuals.
          - Turn on multi-factor authentication and register all other highly-privileged single-user non-federated admin accounts
          - Features:
            - Provide **just-in-time** privileged access to Azure AD and Azure resources
            - Assign **time-bound access** to resources using start and end dates
            - Require **approval** to activate privileged roles
            - Enforce **multi-factor authentication** to activate any role
            - Use **justification** to understand why users activate
            - Get **notifications** when privileged roles are activated
            - Conduct **access reviews** to ensure users still need roles
            - Download **audit history** for internal or external audit
  2. Stage 2: Mitigate the most frequently used attack techniques *(2-4 weeks)*
      - Conduct an inventory of services, owners, and admins
        - Identify the users who have administrative roles and the services where they can manage.
        - Use Azure AD PIM to find out which users in your organization have admin access to Azure AD, including additional roles beyond those listed in Stage 1.
        - Ensure that your admin accounts have working email addresses attached to them and have registered for Azure MFA or use MFA on-premises.
      - Identify Microsoft accounts in administrative roles that need to be switched to work or school accounts
      - Ensure separate user accounts and mail forwarding for global administrator accounts
      - Ensure the passwords of administrative accounts have recently changed
      - Turn on password hash synchronization
      - Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users in all privileged roles as well as exposed users
      - Configure **Identity Protection** *(ML to asses risks)*
        - **Detecting vulnerabilities and risky accounts**
          - Providing custom recommendations to improve overall security posture by highlighting vulnerabilities
          - Calculating sign-in risk levels
          - Calculating user risk levels
        - **Investigating risk events**
          - Sending notifications for risk events
          - Investigating risk events using relevant and contextual information
          - Providing basic workflows to track investigations
          - Providing easy access to remediation actions such as password reset
        - **Risk-based conditional access policies**
          - Policy to mitigate risky sign-ins by blocking sign-ins or requiring multi-factor authentication challenges
          - Policy to block or secure risky user accounts
          - Policy to require users to register for multi-factor authentication
      - Monitor **Azure Activity Log**
  3. Stage 3: Build visibility and take full control of admin activity *(1-3 months)*
      - Complete an access review of users in administrator roles
      - Establish integrated monitoring
        - The **Azure Security Center** provides integrated security monitoring and policy management across your Azure subscriptions, helps detect threats that may otherwise go unnoticed, and works with a broad ecosystem of security solutions.
      - Inventory your privileged accounts within hosted Virtual Machines
        - Grant only the amount of access to users who need to perform specific jobs
      - Integrate information protection
        - **Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS)** scans & classifies based on policies using **Azure Information Protection** classification labels.
          - E.g. confidentiality levels

## Conditional access policies

- **When this happens** -> **then do this**
- You also set Users the users performing an access attempt (**who**).
- Cloud apps: The targets of an access attempt (**what**).
- Controls (**when** this happens)
  - **Grant controls**
    - Support *AND* and *OR* operators.
    - **Compliant device**: Azure AD registered devices, Azure AD joined devices, Hybrid Azure AD joined devices
      - ***Hybrid Azure AD joined devices***: Windows desktops, laptops, and enterprise tablets that are joined to an on-premises Active Directory
    - **Approved client app** through Intune app protection policies
    - Enforce acceptance of **Terms of Use**
    - **Custom controls**: Validation through custom APIs.
  - **Session controls**
    - **Use app enforced restrictions**: The device information enables the cloud apps to know whether a connection is initiated from a compliant or domain-joined device.
